The teaching is going to be done in this environment to minimize setup problems. I will try to cover runing Python in your environment to a degree and we can have a Q&A about it in the course of the event.

## Lesson plan in a mind map
This mind map covers the lesson plan for two sessions. We are going to get through Python basics in the first session and go into more advanced topics depending on success of the first session.
