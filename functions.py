"""
One of very powerful common constructs in modern languages is function.
It gives you an ability to logically group the code, redistribute and reuse it.

# let's build a greeting function
# 1) print Greetings to you from Python
# 2) pull "Python" out into a variable
# 3) wrap both lines into a function without a parameter - discuss scope
# 4) run code and see that function is not executed
# 5) call declared function
# 6) turn variable with value "Python" into parameter and pass literal to the function
# 7) use formatting from within print to create a greeting and return it, print returned value outside

#revisit scope

# passing positional parameters in

# passing in key word arguments

# default values

# beware of mutable default values

# creating and accessing optional positional parameters and keyword arguments 

# passing kwargs through without reusing them

# unrolling dictionarry into parameters

# returning multiple values and unrolling them into a tuple

# type hints - simple types

# type hints - collection

# yield key word and generators

# switch case using dictionarry and functions (add, sbutract, multiply, divide)

# lambda

# same switch case with lambdas

# closure in lambda - using variable from external scope
