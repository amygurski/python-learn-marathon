"""
One of very powerful common constructs in modern languages is function.
It gives you an ability to logically group the code, redistribute and reuse it.
"""

#declare basic function with pass for body
#revisit scope

# passing positional parameters in

# passing in key word arguments

# default values

# beware of mutable default values

# creating and accessing optional positional parameters and keyword arguments 

# passing kwargs through without reusing them

# unrolling dictionarry into parameters

# returning multiple values and unrolling them into a tuple

# type annotations - simple types

# type annotations - collection

# yield key word and generators

# switch case using dictionarry and functions (add, sbutract, multiply, divide)

# lambda

# same switch case with lambdas

# closure in lambda - using variable from external scope
