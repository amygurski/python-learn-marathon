# Introduction
In **Gagarin Academy**, we are taking on a **new** learning journey in a way that has **not** been tried before. We are **aiming** to give a voice to **those** that have a lot of thoughtful knowledge to share, but **don't** have a suitable venue to share it.

Today each **one** of us in the "space race" **trying** to remain professionally **viable** and **valuable**. **Some** are trying to shift from an original course they were on, seeking a new more interesting adventure.

At Gagarin Academy, we want to create an **experience of learning** that can seep into your world daily. We want to help you build a **complete** context for the journey you are trying to undertake.

## Building Context
As **each** of us starts on the journey of learning, we **enter** into our first room of **basic knowledge** and start **examining** basic components. Once we have covered **enough** of these rooms we gain **basic** ability to operate in our **new** world. The problem, however, is that our **newly gained knowledge** gave us an ability to **throttle** and **turn** our ship in these new waters. It did **nothing** to give us **directions** as to where we should go from here, let **alone** helped us read the **map**.

On **other** occasions, we exist **adjacent** to large knowledge domains **trying** to navigate through them as our **primary** calling. This is the space where such professions as **product**, **project** and **people** management reside. If you **come** to that space from **non-technical** background understanding of product **alone** will serve you only **so far**. You **need** to comprehend the **technical** domain with its **parts** and **pieces* and their **interaction** to do your job well.

At **Gagarin Academy**, we are going to build an overview of domains in their high-level entirety as well as in low-level detail. We will do it in small ingestible pieces that you will be able to consume through a variety of handy resources. We understand that it is difficult to dedicate time to learning such vast spheres in a busy professional life, so we are building a platform that will allow you to build your knowledge as part of your daily routine and in between your tasks.
